I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the heck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my gosh darn words. You think you can get away with saying that tom-foolery to me over the Internet? Think again, poophead. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, weenie-hut junior. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're gosh darn dead, kiddo. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your poopy pants tushy off the face of the continent, you little weenie. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your darn tootin tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, poophead.\r\n",
